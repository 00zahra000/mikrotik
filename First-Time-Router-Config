## To reset all former congfigs or reset everything on a mikrotik:
/system reset-configuration no-defaults=yes skip-backup=yes


## Configuring IP Access:
Since MAC connection is not very stable, the first thing we need to do is to set up a router so that IP connectivity is available:

    add bridge interface and bridge ports;
    add an IP address to LAN interface;
    set up a DHCP server.

/interface bridge add name=local
/interface bridge port add interface=ether1 bridge=local
/ip address add address=192.168.4.6 interface=local

## The next step is to set up a DHCP server. We will run the setup command for easy and fast configuration:

[admin@MikroTik] /ip dhcp-server setup 
Select interface to run DHCP server on
 
dhcp server interface: local 
Select network for DHCP addresses
 
dhcp address space: 192.168.4.0 
Select gateway for given network
 
gateway for dhcp network: 192.168.4.1 (192.168.4.2)
Select pool of ip addresses given out by DHCP server
 
addresses to give out: 192.168.4.2-192.168.4.254
Select DNS servers

dns servers: 192.168.4.1 
Select lease time
 
lease time: 3d (10m for the default)


## Dynamic Public IP
Dynamic address configuration is the simplest one.
You just need to set up a DHCP client on the public interface.
DHCP client will receive information from an internet service provider (ISP) and set up an IP address, DNS, NTP servers, and default route for you.

[admin@MikroTik] /ip dhcp-client add disabled=no interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] /ip dhcp-client> print

## Static Public IP
In the case of static address configuration, your ISP gives you parameters, for example:

    IP: 1.2.4.0
    Gateway: 1.2.3.1
    DNS: 8.8.8.8

These are three basic parameters that you need to get the internet connection working

To set this in RouterOS we will manually add an IP address, add a default route with a provided gateway, and set up a DNS server
/ip address add address=1.2.3.100/24 interface=ether1
/ip route add gateway=1.2.3.1
/ip dns set servers=8.8.8.8
