## To reset all former congfigs or reset everything on a mikrotik:
/system reset-configuration no-defaults=yes skip-backup=yes


## Configuring IP Access:
Since MAC connection is not very stable, the first thing we need to do is to set up a router so that IP connectivity is available:

    add bridge interface and bridge ports;
    add an IP address to LAN interface;
    set up a DHCP server.

/interface bridge add name=local
/interface bridge port add interface=ether1 bridge=local
/ip address add address=192.168.4.6 interface=local

## The next step is to set up a DHCP server. We will run the setup command for easy and fast configuration:

[admin@MikroTik] /ip dhcp-server setup 
Select interface to run DHCP server on
 
dhcp server interface: local 
Select network for DHCP addresses
 
dhcp address space: 192.168.4.0 
Select gateway for given network
 
gateway for dhcp network: 192.168.4.1 (192.168.4.2)
Select pool of ip addresses given out by DHCP server
 
addresses to give out: 192.168.4.2-192.168.4.254
Select DNS servers

dns servers: 192.168.4.1 
Select lease time
 
lease time: 3d (10m for the default)


## Dynamic Public IP
Dynamic address configuration is the simplest one.
You just need to set up a DHCP client on the public interface.
DHCP client will receive information from an internet service provider (ISP) and set up an IP address, DNS, NTP servers, and default route for you.

[admin@MikroTik] /ip dhcp-client add disabled=no interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] /ip dhcp-client> print

## Static Public IP
In the case of static address configuration, your ISP gives you parameters, for example:

    IP: 1.2.4.100
    Gateway: 1.2.4.100
    DNS: 8.8.8.8

These are three basic parameters that you need to get the internet connection working

To set this in RouterOS we will manually add an IP address, add a default route with a provided gateway, and set up a DNS server
/ip address add address=1.2.4.100 interface=ether1
/ip route add gateway=1.2.4.1
/ip dns set servers=8.8.8.8

/ping 192.168.4.6
/ping 8.8.8.8
/ping google.com


## MAC Connectivity Access

By default mac server runs on all interfaces, so we will disable default all entry and add a local interface to disallow MAC connectivity from the WAN port.
MAC Telnet Server feature allows you to apply restrictions to the interface "list".

    First, create an interface list:
        [admin@MikroTik] > /interface list add name=listBridge

    Then, add your previously created bridge named "local" to the interface list:
        [admin@MikroTik] > tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=listBridge

    Apply newly created "list" (of interfaces) to the MAC server:
        [admin@MikroTik] > /interface list member add list=listBridge interface=local
        
    Do the same for Winbox MAC access
        [admin@MikroTik] > tool mac-server mac-winbox set allowed-interface-list=listBridge
        
## Neighbor Discovery
MikroTik Neighbor discovery protocol is used to show and recognize other MikroTik routers in the network. (Disable neighbor discovery on public interfaces)

/ip neighbor discovery-settings set discover-interface-list=listBridge
